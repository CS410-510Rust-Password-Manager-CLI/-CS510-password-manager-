# Password Manager CLI
Authors: Tareq Jallad, Haohan Jiang  

## Description
This project uses Rust to implement a command line password manager. This CLI application allows the user to
create, delete, list, and modify secret entries and secret stores, all through the command line.
For user security, all input passwords and usernames are encrypted by a randomly generated RSA Private key.
